# ðŸ¤– Agentic AI Demo â€” Goal â†’ Tool â†’ Guardrail Foundation

This project demonstrates the **foundation of Agentic AI systems** using **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, **LangSmith**, and **Guardrails-AI**.  
It showcases how an autonomous agent can take a **goal**, decide which **tools** to use, execute them, and apply **guardrails** to ensure safe, explainable, and controlled outcomes.

## ðŸš€ Features

-  **Goal-driven Agent** â€” The agent starts from a natural-language goal
- **Tool Integration** â€” Executes predefined tools like web search and summarization.
- **Guardrail System** â€” Checks for PII, toxicity, or unsafe responses using `guardrails-ai`.
-  **LangGraph Workflow** â€” Defines the agentic flow as a directed graph of actions and checks.
- **LangSmith Tracing** â€” Full observability of agent decisions, inputs/outputs, and tool usage in the [LangSmith UI](https://smith.langchain.com).
-  **Hugging Face + Transformers** â€” Uses local models for summarization (e.g., `facebook/bart-large-cnn`).
-  **OpenAI / Hugging Face API Ready** â€” Pluggable LLM integration for goal reasoning or summarization.
